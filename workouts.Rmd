Lets analyze my gym routine


How many different workouts do I in total? 21

```{r}
data("workouts.csv")
library(tidyverse)
w <- read.csv("workouts.csv")
n_distinct(w$Excercise)

```

What is the max, min, and average amount of reps that I do for all excercies?

```{r}
w %>%
  summarise(max(w$Reps),min(w$Reps),mean(w$Reps))
```
